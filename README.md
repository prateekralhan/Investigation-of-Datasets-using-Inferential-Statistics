# Investigation-of-Datasets-using-Inferential-Statistics
In this project, I analyzed a dataset on No Show Appointments By Kaggle for May 2016, and then communicated my findings about it. 
I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.
I have successfully run the scripts in Jupyter notebook as well as successfully generated desired results that helped me 
derive my conclusions.
I have also provided a document encoded using HTML and some Javascript, describing about the inferences drawn regarding it.
